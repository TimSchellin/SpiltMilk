You can not mix all Trilobites and rank them as if they where one species. In the Cambrium there were (simplifyed) 2 big groups of Trilobites: Redlichia and Olenellus (""evolving"" into Paradoxides and later Olenus). Furthermore the Trilobite species had completly (accounting cambrian circumstances) different lifestyles (living on or in the ground(Trilobites whithout eyes)). The size and ""armor""(shell) of Trilobite differs also a lot. Marella (shown in your video) had almost no shell left but could swim in water. As a conclusion: You can not rank ""Trilobite"" as a whole in C tier only certain destinct ""bilds"" from the Trilobite ""guild"" PS: It is a realy nice video and it is cool that you inform people about this interesting time period.

As a species, they were nothing less than meta-defining. 

They survived 270 million years and it took three radical patches to completely remove them; the Ordovician‚ÄìSilurian extinction patch, the late Devonian extinction patch and the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction patch (the worst of all patches, nerfing 95% of all ocean species out of the game). There's always a tendency among newer players to look down on the past meta, but we should respect our elders who were playing in different versions of the game.

A lot of bugs didn't really come along until insect flight got really popular because of how it exploits the physics engine. Sometimes the high frequency of the wings would sometimes lead to molecules shattering the insect's shell due to clipping when the wings would exceed the programmed maximum frequency of 256 Hertz. The devs decided that instead of removing the mechanic of flight, they would instead embrace the bug and the devs upped the cap to something nearly unthinkable, 1.855 * 10^43 Hertz as reverse engineer Max Planck managed to find while trying to reverse program the game to figure out why the famous ""blackbody radiation"" glitch couldn't be recreated.",38

The alpha wasn't particularly interesting compared to what we have now, but it was still way more than single celled builds. The chemistry simulator you're talking about was a pre-alpha proof of concept.

People tend to forget about the Avalon expansion because it was nothing like what we've had since the Cambrian. When the Cambrian hit, there was a near complete change in playerbase over the new predation mechanic: what used to be an idle farming game suddenly turned into an action rpg. A lot of people just werrent into that, but despite that, the size of the playerbase exploded. Pretty controversial.

The biggest feature we got in the Cambrian though was hard components, which have kinda defined the game ever since. Armor hadn't been balanced yet, so that became CRAZY popular. I remember one time a friend of mine managed to kill a player that was attacking him with his body spikes. Good times...

Anyway, back during Avalon, it was all about absorbing nutrients and bacteria from the water. Plants hadnt really been implemented yet. There were algae, but not a lot of players went that route because there wasn't much of a point. Really, I think the devs added plants in the Ordovician just to try and get the Avalon crowd back. With v0.7 or so, they added movement for the first time, prepping for the big Cambrian update, and a lot of players started grazing the bacteria mats that spawned everywhere. Real different game.

Intelligence alone doesn't make a build top tier, even at this point in the meta. Look at pigs, octopuses, rats, or pigeons; they definitely have each had certain successes, with rats and pigeons especially expanding a lot in the new city servers, but they aren't top tier. Their intelligence makes them able to survive well, but they don't have the necessary power to become dominant.
Really, the top builds have pretty much always had high power, with defense, mobility, intelligence, and other stats just determining how well the builds could take advantage of that power.
Take the orca for example. They are very powerful, fast, and durable animals, which already makes them high tier even before their intelligence and social behavior make them dominant. If orcas were like seals but with the intelligence of orcas, they'd still act like seals.

Intelligence can only make a build top the meta if the build has other stats and abilities that make it powerful.",2

Because of his dry delivery, the underwhelming gameplay shown, and the fact that this game about ""historical battles in japan"" features a giant crab as a boss, many great memes were spawned. The internet was a lot slower back then - memes weren't even called memes yet and they were mostly shared on forums and IRC chats, so the lifecycle of a meme tended to be longer and more memorable.

This was probably the intent of the developers when creating this build; however, some of the more exp-hungry veterans (like me) cannot overlook the lucrative opportunity that the Jellyfish class presents. Exp is so easy in some builds of this class (like the Box Jelly, which deters close to every build, or the Inmortal Jelly who can get exp forever until it finds itself in one of its very few bad matchups) that it almost seems like an oversight by the devs to have such an easy but rewarding class. Easy exp since the Cambrian",1

TZ may have been inspired by something else. That doesn't make it any less HIS success. Otherwise, nobody could ever take claim to any success that they have. Because all ideas are a result of previous ideas already existing. 

Also, those terms...yeah....they're common gaming terms. Even a filthy casual gamer like myself knows that. Ironic that you credit Casually Explained with creating those terms, when it wasn't he who came up with those terms in the first place, while at the same time accusing TZ of stealing the credit.  


And I don't doubt that Casually Explained is a quality series in it of itself. But clearly, so many people enjoy TZ way more. That's not something you can credit Casually Explained for.

Yes, doing an environment based one would be incredibly dumb. Which is why he's made ones for Deep Sea, the Arctic and Australia.

It's possible to compare different kinds of species within the environment in which they compete, especially if they have similar play styles. 
For example, coral, sponges, and anemone are all primarily stationary and can have symbiotic relationships with other kinds of players. They're also very common in reef servers. Interacting with fish does not make it a fish list.",1

And to answer your question, sea sponges were one of the earliest animals. A glance through Wikipedia tells me there are ""approximately 5,000‚Äì10,000¬†known species"", and that's just the extant ones.

Similar story with bivalve molluscs. There's around 9000 species when you include clams, oysters, mussels, cockles and scallops.

Some species are unique to reef servers. If we only look at unique species any list is going to be short, which is okay when you consider no more than half a dozen specific species (or subspecies) are featured in any video.
Also, not every species in a particular biome will be unique to it. Some species are good at living in multiple biomes.

My overall point is that there are many reasons to do a video on coral reefs. You can either do a focus on a particular playstyle or on how successful a species is within that particular environment - which makes up a large percentage of ocean diversity.

Edit: Saying it's a biome in the ocean server is like saying mountain tops/tundra is just a biome on the land server. That's the same thing as a desert or rainforest, right? There's a lot of ocean and a lot of environments in it.",0
